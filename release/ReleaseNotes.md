# Release Notes

- Plugin now works in hosts with variable buffer sizes (e.g. Audacity), for the price of a higher output delay
- Introduced a fix to an issue where the output delay was not reported when switching models during processing
- Introduced new parameter `Bypass`, which bypasses the enhancement while keeping the processing delay active
- Updated JUCE to newest version 8.0.10
