# Installation Guide

Thank you for testing our ai-coustics speech enhancement demo.

## Install Audio Plugin

### macOS

Start the installer by double-clicking `ai-coustics-demo.pkg`.
The first time you open it you will see a warning that the developer can not be verified, just close the Dialog by pressing `Done`.
Now go to System Settings -> Privacy & Security and scroll down to `Security` an click `Open`.
When you open the `.pkg` installer again, the dialog will show `Open anyway` which you will need to click.
Now enter your password and follow the instructions of the installer.
